# autolux

a systemd service to tune the light of a laptop and its associated connected devices controlled by a light sensor.

this works on my linux Mint Laptop combining:

- an iio light sensor exists on your system
- your laptop backlight sensor can be controlled by `brithnessctl`
- your connected displays can be tuned with `ddcutil`

bugs included... for free !

it works for me, I could not find anything satisfactory, so I am spinning mine. 

you have been warned :-)
